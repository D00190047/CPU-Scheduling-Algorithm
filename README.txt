Notes:
1. STCF / RR is not working, unfortunately.
2. To compile - gcc main.c lib/utils.c -o build/main, then ./build/main userInput

Additional functionality:
print all processes sorted by their process ID - using "printall".

Update: SJF implementation is incorrect. Did not take arrival time into account.
